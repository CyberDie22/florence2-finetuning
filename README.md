# Florence2-Finetuning
A quick exploration into fine-tuning Florence-2 on the DocVQA dataset.

## Installation

We use UV to manage packages. UV is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust. You can get [it here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/).

To get started, run the following commands:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv install requirements.txt
```

If you encounter issues with flash-attn, you can fix it with the following command:

```bash
uv pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## Get the data

For this experiment, we use the DocVQA dataset. Our team at Hugging Face has already uploaded a version to the hub, so you can use it directly.

The dataset is preprocessed for easy handling. After loading it with HF's dataset library, it looks like this:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

data = load_dataset('HuggingFaceM4/DocumentVQA')

print(data)
```
Output:

```python
DatasetDict({
    train: Dataset({
        features: ['questionId', 'question', 'question_types', 'image', 'docId', 'ucsf_document_id', 'ucsf_document_page_no', 'answers'],
        num_rows: 39463
    })
    validation: Dataset({
        features: ['questionId', 'question', 'question_types', 'image', 'docId', 'ucsf_document_id', 'ucsf_document_page_no', 'answers'],
        num_rows: 5349
    })
    test: Dataset({
        features: ['questionId', 'question', 'question_types', 'image', 'docId', 'ucsf_document_id', 'ucsf_document_page_no', 'answers'],
        num_rows: 5188
    })
})
```

## Hacking Florence-2 code

To fine-tune Florence-2, you need to modify the `Florence2Seq2SeqLMOutput` class in the cached file downloaded when you first got the model. In my installation, this was found under:

```bash
/admin/home/andres_marafioti/.cache/huggingface/modules/transformers_modules/microsoft/Florence-2-base/a2f0be72f9e50b3183c8c2c28ff481bd837320f5/modeling_florence2.py
```

Find the class and overwrite it with the following code:

```python
@dataclass
class Florence2Seq2SeqLMOutput(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for Florence-2 model's outputs that also contains : pre-computed hidden states that can speed up sequential
    decoding.

            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.

            If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1,
            hidden_size)` is output.

            `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

            Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention

        decoder_hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
            one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the decoder at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.

            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights of the decoder's cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax, used to compute the
            weighted average in the cross-attention heads.

            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder of the model.
        encoder_hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
